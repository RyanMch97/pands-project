Iris Dataset Research - 09/04/2022

My research on the Iris Dataset begin by simplying downloading & researching the Iris Dataset online.
From downloading it & viewing it in MS Excel we can see the variables presented.
The 4 variables measured by Dr. Fisher when creating this dataset was the following: sepal's Length, Sepal's Width, Petal Length & Sepal Width.
He measured these 4 variables across the following Setoasha, Versicolor & Virginica.

Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica

Two of the main Reasons for the majority of people starting out using this Dataset when it comes to the Data Analytics is the following.

1- Small dataset, overall it only contains 750 Datapoints in total. Allows for easier analysis rather than starting out on a more complez dataset where plotting chart's etc may prove more diffucult to beginners
2- Use of Real world Data on a non complex subject. The adfvantage of using Real world data on a simple object like Floweres allows us to better visualise & undertand what the differences are in each Flower that was measured.
